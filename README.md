Prymbot runs on Ubuntu 20.04 OS and uses the ROS Noetic framework. 

The following major components are installed on the robot:
1. Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB Version)
2. Arduino Nano V3
3. 2D lidar ([from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001253880158.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.573f1802iVwUdw))
