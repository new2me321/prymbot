# prymbot

Prymbot is a 4-wheeled non-holonomic robot developed by myself to test my competencies with the Robot Operating System (ROS). 

The following major components are installed on the robot:
1. Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB Version)
2. Arduino Nano V3
3. 2D lidar ([from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001253880158.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.573f1802iVwUdw))
4. Raspberry Pi Cam rev 1.3 ([from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32986293504.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.573f1802iVwUdw))

In future, I will update the system to support ROS 2.
